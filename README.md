WARNING: Before I uploaded to github, the 1.0 files got infected. downloading might download viruses, so its reccomended to use of a VM. Or just download 1.1 or later


NEW: safer version: how to install:


Download the latest safe version form the releases tab and then once downloaded unzip it and put it in the users folder, unless there is already a file called public there, if there is, open the one you downloaded and drag the folder thingy into your public folder. IF it is not there, drag the whole public folder that you downloaded into the users folder. 


To run the Dominator, open thingy and run the file called run. it gives you a warning, click yes or no or close it to start. If you change your mind, close with task manager. Make sure to use on a VM just to be safe ;)
